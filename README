PCIE driver for FPGA device

1.1. Overview

This driver is based on original driver for the PCIe SG DMA project
placed at the opencores.org
The driver is mostly in maintenance state. Changes cover mostly updating driver
to work with newer kernels and deleting support for really old kernels (which
obfuscates the code). Also, with present makefiles it's easier to cross-compile
code (e.g. using buildroot).

It consists of two parts:
- kernel driver at driver/pcie
- c/c++ library at lib/pcie
Plus basic test units for driver, lib & hardware testing
All relevant includes are in include/pcie folder.

1.2. INSTALL

To compile and install kernel driver go to driver/pcie and issue 'make && make install'

To install library go to lib/pcie and type 'make && make install'

1.3. TODO

- test interrupt support
- make HW tests more friendly to causal user, stop them from spewing out
thousand of hex output lines
- any changes that will be required
